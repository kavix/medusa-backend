# Azure Web Apps Automation Summary

## 🎯 Automation Achievement

Successfully implemented **fully automated** Azure web app management with intelligent cleanup across multiple GitHub Actions workflows.

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Smart Cleanup Scripts**
- `cleanup-latest-only.sh` - Intelligent script that keeps only the latest app
- `manual-cleanup.sh` - Interactive manual cleanup with confirmations

### 2. **Automated GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### **Primary Workflows:**
- `auto-deploy.yml` - ✅ **UPDATED** - Auto-cleanup after every commit
- `azure-deploy.yml` - ✅ **UPDATED** - Cleanup after main branch deployments
- `smart-deploy-cleanup.yml` - ✅ **NEW** - Combined smart deploy & cleanup
- `daily-cleanup.yml` - ✅ **NEW** - Daily scheduled cleanup at 3 AM UTC
- `cleanup-webapps.yml` - ✅ **UPDATED** - Manual/scheduled cleanup workflow

#### **Automation Features:**
✅ **Zero manual intervention required**  
✅ **Automatic detection of latest deployment**  
✅ **Intelligent cleanup after every deployment**  
✅ **Daily scheduled maintenance**  
✅ **Manual override capabilities**  
✅ **Comprehensive logging and reporting**  
✅ **Health checks on remaining apps**  
✅ **GitHub Actions summaries with detailed reports**  

## 🎯 Current Status

**Before automation:** 3 web apps  
**After cleanup:** 1 web app (`medusa-main-9e89f62`)  

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Automatic Triggers:**
1. **Every Git Push** → Deploy new app → Auto-cleanup old ones
2. **Every Day at 3 AM UTC** → Cleanup any accumulated apps
3. **After Deployments** → Immediate cleanup of old apps
4. **Manual Trigger** → On-demand cleanup anytime

### **Smart Logic:**
- Identifies latest app by **creation timestamp**
- Keeps **only the most recent deployment**
- Deletes **all older apps automatically**
- Tests remaining app for health
- **Zero confirmation needed** in CI/CD

## 📊 Automation Benefits

✅ **Cost Optimization** - No more paying for unused old deployments  
✅ **Resource Management** - Automatic cleanup prevents accumulation  
✅ **Zero Maintenance** - Fully automated, no manual intervention  
✅ **Always Latest** - Only the newest deployment remains active  
✅ **Monitoring** - Detailed reports and health checks  
✅ **Flexibility** - Multiple trigger methods (push, schedule, manual)
